Develop Without Code
- metadata-driven development model
- no code and low code development approaches

The power of metadata
- three important terms: objects, fields, records
- salesforce has metadata-aware architecture (salesforce is DB abstraction, not UI)
- objects are database tables, fields are columns, records are rows
- true for both standard objects and custom objects that you build yourself
- metadata forms the structure of your org
	- metadata holds your configuration
	- the platform then renders your app's metadata in the user interface along with associated data
- metadata-driven development model is key difference between dev on platform and outsides of salesforce
- platform can auto-generate a significant part of your user experience for you
