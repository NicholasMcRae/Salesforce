Lightning Platform API Basics
*****************************

API First at Salesforce
- Salesforce takes an API-first approach to building features on the Salesforce Platform
- API first means building a robust API for a feature before focusing on designing its UI
- this approach gives the salesforce developer flexibility to manipulate data however you want

Salesforce Data APIs
- REST API
	- RESTful principles
	- Exposes all sorts of Salesforce functionality via REST resources and HTTP methods
	- CRUD records
	- Search or Query your data
	- Retrieeve metadata
	- Access information about limits in your org
	- Supports both XML and JSON
	- Great for writing mobile and web apps
- SOAP API
	- Supports XML only
	- same as REST, just which you need to use
- Bulk API
	- for loading and querying lots of data at once
	- By lots, we mean 50 000 records or more
- Streaming API
	- For setting up notifications that trigger when changes are made to your data
- API Access and Authentication
	- 
- API Limits
	- Salesforce limits the number of API calls per org to ensure the health of the instance
	- These limits exist to prevent rogue scripts from smashing our servers into driftwoord
- When to use
	- Data on each API
	
User Interface API
******************
- We built a powerful platform that gives you even more access to customize Salesforce. That's Lightning
- Lightning is the Salesforce user experience platform (Lightning Experience), and UI Framework (Lightning Web Component Framework)
	- Gives you access to different layers of the Salesforce platform
